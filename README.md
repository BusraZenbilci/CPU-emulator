# CPU-emulator

Write a CPU emulator software that supports a basic instruction set (15 instructions) given below. Assume that the computer has 256 bytes of available memory (M) initially set to zero. Your emulator should load a program code froma text file. For simplicity you can store the program code in any data type you like.
The  following example  code  is  an  app  that  can  compute  the  sum  of  the  numbers  between  0  and  20.  Your  emulator  must execute this sample code at minimum. Note that I may test your emulator with any code that is supportedby the instruction set. You can implement your code in Java. Assume that initially all flags are set to zero.
