# CPU-emulator

Write a CPU emulator software that supportsa basic instruction set (15 instructions) given below. Assume that the computerhas 256bytes of available memory (M) initially set to zero. Your emulator should load a program code froma text file. For simplicityyou can store the program code in any data type you like. The use of your emulatoris like: # java a1YourStudentIdprogram.txt The  followingexample  code  is  an  app  that  can  compute  the  sum  of  the  numbers  between  0  and  20.  Your  emulator  must execute this sample code at minimum. Note that I may test your emulator with any code that is supportedby the instruction set. You can implement your code in Java. Assume that initially all flags are set to zero.
